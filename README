This is a Vim add-on to check for common errors in color schemes.

DOCUMENTATION
-------------
Main documentation is located in the doc/ directory.

The file color-scheme-recommendations.txt contains some guidelines and
help for writing color schemes.

PATCHES

The patches/ directory contains patches for some of the color schemes
that are available on vim.org or elsewhere on the Internet, as well as
documentation for those patches. Most notably, a patch is included for
the color schemes in ColorSamplerPack.zip, a collection of the most
popular color schemes from vim.org:
