colorcheck Introduction                                     *colorcheck-intro*

This is an add-on for Vim that checks for common issues in Vim color schemes.
It implements a single public function, |colorcheck#Check()|, which takes as
its argument the name of the color scheme to check. The output is written into
Vim's message log and can be reviewed with |:messages|.

                                                          *'g:colorcheck_log'*
The ouptut is also placed in the list variable 'g:colorcheck_log' for
convenience.

colorcheck#Check({name})                                  *colorcheck#Check()*
    {name} must be a string giving the name of a color scheme available in
    'runtimepath'. Runs checks an that file and reports results in the Vim
    message log.
